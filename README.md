# TDD.ex

## Why?

Let's be honest: TDD tooling in the Elixirland(as well elsewhere) sucks. Usually involves wrestling with the terminal, starting and stopping stuff. Tagging tests. There has to be a better way. We can do better!

Filtering tests and running only failures should cost us little to no time. This process has to be as ergonomic as possible, leaving out also some API where people can write text editor extensions and make the process of selecting what you want to run, or if you want to run failures, with the minimal amount of keystrokes as possible(preferably none, maybe Human Brain <-> Computer API?).

This project aims to not be just yet another update files + run tests "TDD" library. It is also experimental in a way, let's see where it goes.

## Roadmap

- [x] License?
- [x] Be able to detect file changes correctly
- [ ] Run tests?
- [ ] Create basic command line tool which is always running and let people filter etc
- [ ] Expose the command line into an API, so text editor integrations are possible.

## Installation
